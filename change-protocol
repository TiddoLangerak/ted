Changes are done like this:

- User inputs *high-level* commands to make some changes (e.g. "change inner word").
- Client translates these commands to *low-level* operations on text (e.g. delete column 3-10 at line 2, or delete character 20-24)
- Client sends the *low-level* operation to the server
- Server processes the *low-level* operation on it's buffer and broadcasts the *low-level* change to the clients
- Clients process the *low-level* operation on it's internal representation of the buffer

For the initial state clients may *not* process operations to the visual buffer before they got a response from the server to prevent race conditions. This will have to be thought out properly first
